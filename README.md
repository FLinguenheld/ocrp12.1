### Documentation

All endpoints are explained in the Postman documentation :  

[![Logo PostMan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FLinguenheld/ocrp12.1/main/logos/postman.png "Postman")](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19051270/2s8YzXwLV1)

To easily add several users, you can use the file *postman_init.py*.  
üí° You need user credentials who's authorised to create new users (admin or manager).  

Launch the server in a terminal. Then open a new one, move into the root folder and use the command :  

    python postman_init.py --email <admin@epiccrm.com> --password <admin01234>

Five users will be created :

    manager@postman.com
    salesperson@postman.com
    salesperson_2@postman.com
    technical_support@postman.com
    test@test.com

    test01234

****
### Database

This application uses [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org). You have to install it according to your distribution then 
create a dabase and an user with this information :

    database name : epic_events
    user : epic_user
    user password : 01234

Django will search the database on *localhost* with the port *5432*.  
You can change this behaviour in the settings files.

Here an example to create or delete a database :

    sudo -u postgres psql
    create database epic_events;
    drop database epic_events;

Django administration is activated, you can create a superuser and open it with the link :  
http://localhost:8000/admin/

    python manage.py createsuperuser

****
### Permissions

Once the first migration is done, groups 'manager' and 'sales' are added.  
To create a manager, create a new user, check the box **staff** and add the group **manager**.  

- manager :  
All staff users can open the admin panel (with restricted actions) and due to the manager group, they can manipulate data.  
Staff users also have a write access on all endpoints.  

- sales :  
All users in this group are authorized to create a new customer.  
Superuser and staff (managers) are allowed to add or remove users of this group.  

****
### Testing

This code used the framework [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) and the plugin [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to test endpoints.  
To launch a new test, open a terminal, navigate into the root folder and activate the virtual environment.  
Then launch the command :

    pytest -v
